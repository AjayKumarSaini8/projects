Create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
On macOS and Linux:

source venv/bin/activate
On Windows (Command Prompt):
venv\Scripts\activate

Install the project dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Apply database migrations:
python manage.py migrate

Create a superuser to access the admin panel:
python manage.py createsuperuser

Start the development server:
python manage.py runserver

Usage
Access the Django admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin/ and log in with your superuser credentials.

Use the admin panel to manage students, teachers, and certificates.

To access the API and generate JWT tokens, refer to the API Endpoints section below.

API Endpoints
The project provides the following API endpoints:

/api/token/: Get a JWT token by sending a POST request with your credentials.
/api/token/refresh/: Refresh an existing token.
/api/token/verify/: Verify a token's validity.
Customize and add more endpoints as needed for your project's requirements.

Make sure to replace placeholders like `yourusername` and update the project-specific details, including the features, requirements, and API endpoints, as needed. This README provides a starting point, and you can expand upon it based on your project's complexity and requirements.
